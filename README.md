## Red Squirrel Study

The basis of this study is to work with visualizations using either the Seaborn or Plotly libraries and to recreate a given scatterplot.

<h3>Project Guidelines:</h3>

**Recreate the original plot as closely as possible**
<ul>
<li>Title and axis labels</li>
<li>Axis ticks and ranges</li>
<li>Legend</li>
<li>Magenta and green data points (colors don’t need to be exact)</li>
<li>Grouping and presentation of the data</li>
</ul>    

This will be accomplished through a combination of functions and parameters that you’ve learned in this course, along with some that you didn’t. Independant research will also be used to accomplish certain formatting
