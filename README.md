## Red Squirrel Study

The basis of this study is to work with visualizations using either the Seaborn or Plotly libraries to recreate a scatterplot.
In recreating the plot, it will help to learn how to customize visualizations using different plotting libraries. 

Here is the scatter plot that will be recreated:

## Analysis Steps:
| Step |Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Import libraries |
| 2 | Upload and analyize data |
| 3 | Data cleaning and preparation |
| 5 | Recreate the figure as closely as possible |
| 6 | Customize Title and axis labels, axis ticks and ranges |
| 7 | Customize Legend |
| 8 | Use colors magenta and green for that data points |
| 9 | Group and present the data |

## Project Conslucsion(s):
Insight: The plot shows that squirrels that were fed diet 'B' had a higher adult weight than the other two diets. There are two anomolies wtih the B diet: one of the female squirrels had the lowest weight out of either diet and one of the male squirrels had the highest weight out of either diet.

It would be interesting to see what conditions the squirrels were kept in and the overall health status of the female that had the lowest weight.
